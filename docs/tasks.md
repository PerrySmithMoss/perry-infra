# Infrastructure tasks

Follow-ups for Netdata Community with Cloud-only access. Track work here even
when implementation belongs in an application repository. Completion requires
verification in production; configuration alone is not evidence of coverage.

- [x] **Add a public health endpoint for Chinwag and external monitoring.**
  Completed on 2026-11-11 in [Chinwag PR #7](https://github.com/PerrySmithMoss/chinwag/pull/7).
  Public `/healthz` supports GET/HEAD, returns 200 with minimal no-store JSON
  (no body for HEAD), and performs no authentication or database work.
  This measures process liveness; existing application authentication and the
  Docker probe remain intact. Image smoke tests and the
  [production release](https://github.com/PerrySmithMoss/chinwag/actions/runs/43102183437)
  passed, followed by public GET/HEAD and protected-route checks.
  [UptimeRobot monitor](https://dashboard.uptimerobot.com/monitors/804640419)
  reports Up with a five-minute interval and owner email alerts enabled.

- [x] **Add a public health endpoint for Vita Track and external monitoring.**
  Completed on 2026-11-11 in [Vita Track PR #9](https://github.com/PerrySmithMoss/VitaTrack/pull/9).
  Public `/healthz` supports GET/HEAD, returns 200 with minimal no-store JSON
  (no body for HEAD), and performs no authentication or database work.
  This measures process liveness; GraphQL CSRF protection, authentication, and
  the Docker GraphQL probe remain intact. Image smoke tests and the
  [production release](https://github.com/PerrySmithMoss/VitaTrack/actions/runs/43102279931)
  passed, followed by public GET/HEAD and GraphQL protection/probe checks.
  [UptimeRobot monitor](https://dashboard.uptimerobot.com/monitors/804640428)
  reports Up with a five-minute interval and owner email alerts enabled.

- [ ] **Configure private PostgreSQL metrics collection in Netdata.**
  Design a private connection path from the host agent to the Swarm service;
  PostgreSQL currently has no published port. Use a dedicated non-superuser
  monitoring role with only required permissions and appropriate TLS. Store
  credentials outside Git. Keep application network isolation and the shared
  database administrator credentials intact. Verify connection, transaction,
  and lock/deadlock metrics and relevant alerts without disrupting applications.
  Document configuration, credential rotation, and rollback.

- [ ] **Configure private Redis metrics collection in Netdata.**
  Coordinate with the `PerrySmithMoss/im-listening` infrastructure because Redis
  belongs to that stack. Provide a private collector path and a dedicated ACL
  with only commands required by the collector. Keep Redis off public ports and
  credentials out of Git. Verify memory, evictions, connections, and hit/miss
  metrics, then document configuration, credential rotation, and rollback.

- [ ] **Configure private Traefik request metrics in Netdata.**
  Enable a dedicated private metrics entrypoint and a collector connection path
  through an administrator-reviewed infrastructure change. Do not expose the
  Traefik API/dashboard or metrics publicly, broaden the Docker socket proxy
  ACL, or bypass the existing snapshot approval boundary. Verify request counts,
  latency, and 5xx metrics per service where supported. Document alert settings,
  deployment verification, and rollback.

- [x] **Verify Netdata outage and recovery email delivery.**
  Verified on 2026-11-11: the owner stopped only Netdata and received the Cloud
  Unreachable email. After restarting Netdata, the charts returned and the owner
  received the Reachable recovery email. Production applications remained running.
  The agent passed local Cloud-only checks and was claimed/online; the Cloud
  dashboard showed all nine containers. The temporary claim-token file was removed.

- [ ] **Confirm UptimeRobot email delivery.**
  A test notification was requested for Fleet API, but mailbox receipt has not
  been confirmed. Confirm receipt or resend a test after checking the owner alert
  contact and spam folder. Record the result before considering external-monitor
  notification delivery verified; Netdata emails do not prove this separate path.

- [ ] **Recheck personal email settings on the Community plan after the trial.**
  Confirm Critical, Warning, Clear, Reachable, and Unreachable email selections
  remain enabled after the Business trial ends, or after explicitly switching to
  Community. Keep the tested Netdata outage/recovery result above; this is a
  separate check of post-trial feature availability.
